**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Ashish Shenoy

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✔] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [✔] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [✔] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [✔] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [✔] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [✔] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [✔] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✔] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [✔] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [✔] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [✔] Playback speeds up on each turn (-15 each turn)
* [✔] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
A resource that was extremely helpful was MDN, which is Mozilla Developer Network that gives excellent documentation on the all the syntax 
related questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other than that, the little tutorials on certain concepts were more than enough to complete 
task.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I had was trying to piece together the logic of the memory game. We were given the bulk of the code to begin with but there was also 
an effort to understand how a block of code played a role in how the game works. It took me some time to understand the entire project as a whole
and why you guys made the format this kind of way. How I overcame this obstacle was by looking at the segements of code block by block and see 
how they related to one another. This is particularly true with the Javascript as somethings took a little bit of time to understand why we needed 
those lines to begin with. Another obstacle was surprisingly implementing the guess logic ourselves. The reason this was harder than expected was due
to how we didn't implement the previous code ourselves and therefore I was lost on how to get started. Once I started to grasp how the methods interacted
with each other, the logic was actually very easy to implement. This goes to show how important it is to read up on how everything works and how blocks of code
work together as it is very important to the know the little segements before learning the entire picture.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Personally its to where to go after HTML, CSS, and Frontend Javascript. There is so many tech stacks in the industry being used and I want to know
how does one choose which stack to choose from. I feel that it may come down to the situation as certain technologies have advantages over others but I would
love to hear a professional opinion to add to my current knowledge. I personally went the MERN stack route, where I developed a web app that had Express and MongoDB
as the backend and EJS, HTML, CSS, and frontend Javascript for the frontend. I also recently started learning React to align with the MERN tech stack. However, I'm ready
to learn more about other tech stacks because the industry offers a wide variety to choose from. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours, I would focus on cleanliness as readability is important when others try to read your code. Since this industry is all about
teamwork, all the members must be on the same page and be able to undertsand what you have written, otherwise that is a recipe for chaos. I would definitely
provide documentation to the functions we used in the JS file as we need to let the people know what does this functions specifically do and what is it 
responsible for. Another thing would be improving the UI as clients look at what on the outside rather than looking at the code. Therefore, making the UI 
modern will definiely please clients as no one would like to look at something outdated.
